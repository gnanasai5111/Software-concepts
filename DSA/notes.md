# DataStructures
- A Data Structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

### Types of Data Structures
1. Linear Data Structure : Data elements are arranged sequentially (Arrays, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues).
2. Non Linear Data Structure : Data elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected manner (Trees, Graphs).

#### Time Complexity and Space Complexity
1. **Time Complexity** - Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows relative to the size of its input.
2. **Space Complexity** - Space complexity measures the amount of extra memory an algorithm needs relative to input size n.

####  Asymptotic Notations
- To analyze Time and Space Complexities, we use Asymptotic Notations:
  
##### Big O Notation (O) – Worst Case
- Describes the upper bound of an algorithm.
- Represents the maximum time or space the algorithm will take.

##### Omega Notation (Ω) – Best Case
- Describes the lower bound of an algorithm.
- Represents the minimum time or space required for the best-case scenario.

##### Theta Notation (Θ) – Average Case (Tight Bound)
- Describes the exact (tight) bound – both upper and lower – of time/space in average scenarios.
- Means the algorithm always takes roughly this amount of time or space.

**Common Time Complexities**
- O(1): Constant time – doesn’t depend on input size.
- O(log n): Logarithmic time – Each step reduces the problem size by half.
- O(n): Linear time – Execution time increases directly with input size.
- O(n²): Quadratic time – Time increases with square of input size. nested loops, slow on large inputs.
